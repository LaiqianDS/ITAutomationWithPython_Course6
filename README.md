**Week 1**
qwiklabs assessment: Scale and convert images using PIL 
Introduction

Your company is in the process of updating its website, and they’ve hired a design contractor to create some new icon graphics for the site. But the contractor has delivered the final designs in the wrong format -- rotated 90° and too large. Oof! You’re not able to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast. You’ll need to use Python to get these images ready for launch.
What you’ll do

Use the Python Imaging Library to do the following to a batch of images:

    Open an image

    Rotate an image

    Resize an image

    Save an image in a specific format in a separate directory 

**Week 2**
qwiklabs assessment: process text files with python dictionaries and upload to running web service
Introduction

You’re working at a company that sells second-hand cars. Your company constantly collects feedback in the form of customer reviews. Your manager asks you to take those reviews (saved as .txt files) and display them on your company’s website. To do this, you’ll need to write a script to convert those .txt files and process them into Python dictionaries, then upload the data onto your company’s website (currently using Django).
What you’ll do

    Use the Python OS module to process a directory of text files 

    Manage information stored in Python dictionaries

    Use the Python requests module to upload content to a running Web service

    Understand basic operations for Python requests like GET and POST methods
